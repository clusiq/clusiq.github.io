<p>I am a dedicated and ambitious
Architecture student at ETH
Zurich, finishing my Bachelorâ€˜s
Degree this summer. Through my
early interest in architectural and
industrial design, I started studying
in this field and grew greatly
interested in urban environments,
master planning and research. As
I gained compelling insights into
robotics and digital architecture, I
believe the future of building lies
in the union of handcraft and the
digital.</p>
